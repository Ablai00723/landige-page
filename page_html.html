        I have been trying to create a webpage which will load .tx files from the same directory and display the contents as
        diiferent sections on the page. after some searching, I found the JQuery which would allow me find and display the text
        from any given .txt document, however, I am struggling with another aspect.
        
        I want to be able to add any .txt document to the folder with the page, and have it show up the next time I open the
        page, with no extra code needed. In essence, I will be dropping some text files into the folder and it would be nice for
        them to show up automatically.
        
        It would be greatly appreaciated if somebody can provide some advice or tell me where to look for an answer, as after a
        couple of days of searching, it is beginning to frustrate me.
        
        Thanks</p>
